Jarvis - AI Voice Assistant


Jarvis is a powerful AI voice assistant designed to help you perform various tasks using simple voice commands. Jarvis can send WhatsApp messages, open applications installed on your system or online websites, and keep track of your command history with a built-in SQLite database. The frontend interface is designed with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript to provide a user-friendly experience.

Features
Voice Command Recognition: Interact with Jarvis using natural voice commands.

Send WhatsApp Messages: Instantly send WhatsApp messages through voice commands.

Open Applications: Launch any installed application on your system using voice commands.

Open Online Websites: Access websites by simply telling Jarvis to "open" a website URL or name.

Command History: View and manage a history of all your voice commands stored in SQLite.

User Interface: Clean and responsive UI built with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.

SQLite Database: Stores all command history efficiently for retrieval and management.

Tech Stack
Technology	Purpose
HTML	Frontend markup for user interface
CSS	Styling and layout for a responsive UI
JavaScript	Frontend logic including voice recognition and interaction
SQLite	Lightweight database for storing command history
Python 	Backend to handle voice processing, app launching, and database interactions (if applicable)

How Jarvis Works
Voice Input: Jarvis listens for your commands via microphone input.

Command Processing: Recognizes the intent from your speech (e.g., sending WhatsApp message, opening an app).

Execution:

Sends WhatsApp messages through integrated API or WhatsApp Web automation.

Opens installed system applications or websites via system commands or browser redirects.

History Logging: Each command and its status are logged into the SQLite database.

User Interaction: Users can view past commands and responses through the interface.

Installation & Setup
Clone the repository

bash
Copy
Edit
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/jarvis-ai-assistant.git
cd jarvis-ai-assistant
Install Dependencies

If backend is used (Python example):

bash
Copy
Edit
pip install -r requirements.txt
If Node.js backend is used:

bash
Copy
Edit
npm install
Run the Application

For a pure frontend demo, open index.html in a modern browser.

For backend enabled version, start the server:

bash
Copy
Edit
python run.py

Allow microphone access in your browser to start using voice commands.

Usage
Say "Send WhatsApp message to [contact name] saying [message]" to send a message.

Say "Open [application name]" to launch an installed application.

Say "Open [website name]" to open a website in your browser.

Say "Show history" to view your previous commands and actions.

Use the UI buttons and input fields to manually control Jarvis if needed.
